Abstract— Network virtualization is the future of the telecommunications industry. Software Defined Networking (SDN) is the key technology in the network virtualization space. In SDN, the control plane of networking devices is handled by a central entity called the controller. As our capstone project, we propose to build a universal fault and performance management tool ‘Expedition’ for major SDN controllers in the industry which will monitor the controller as well as the software defined network below it. The research will focus mainly on three aspects. Firstly, identifying ways to extract data from the various SDN controllers and storing it in appropriate databases. Secondly, a centralized entity to make sense out of this raw data for getting Key Performance Indicators (KPI). We will also correlate this raw data for optimized fault management. Thirdly, reporting this data in the form of standardized reports for employees at different organizational levels. Along with this, an abstraction layer is present which will enable the various controls to be monitored. Research efforts would be focused on identifying various competing technologies and products. As a proof of concept, we will be deploying our tool with the following three network controllers : POX, RYU, Open Daylight and Floodlight . Expedition  will be helpful in proactive service assurance which is an important function of the telecommunication Operation Support System (OSS) stack. This proactive monitoring will be crucial to have Service Level Agreements (SLA) intact. This will help an organization increase the profits as well as gain credibility in the industry.
